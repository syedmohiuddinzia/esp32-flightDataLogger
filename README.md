# esp32-flightDataLogger
ESP32 WiFi-based flight controller data logger. This data logger reads GPS, air pressure, temperature, accelerome- ter, gyroscope, and magnetometer with respect to data and time. And a web application that can delete, save, and start/ stop logging. And an SOS button to send data to a known person on Whatsapp.
